I am expeccting left-handed > footman > tanenbaum, though the timing for left-handed and footman is almost same. According to me, tanenbaum soltuion gives maximum concurrency as we check the neighbours whether they are hungry. In footman solution, there is a server which checks who is hungry hence is concurrency is high, but it is less than that tanenbaum. Left-handed has least concurrency compared to the three, 
I checked for multiple inputs
